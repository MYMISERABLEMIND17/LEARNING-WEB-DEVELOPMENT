        1> default 
        2>named export => named export mai import karte time {variable ka name }


--> real dom and virtual dom 
        real dom => jo actually web ka structure hota hai , full dom tree 
        virtual dom => this is react ke khud ka dom which is the copy of the real dom toh ab agar khuch bhi update karns huaa toh fir vitual dom mai hoga .
        
--> <> </> => empty tags , called fragements 
--> App.jsx >> main.jsx >> html file >> browser 
--> eslint => this helps in the make the custom rules 

--> to declare a class of any element we use className , not only class
--> if you want to write with a variable you can import it in {}
        example : let age = 50 ;
                console.log("My age is {age}")
